# Password Generator Using Javascript

This project was created with the purpose to learn, practice and properly exicute javascript functions to make a randomized password generator where the user can customize the outcome. The user is given options for what they would like their password to contain and how long they would like the password to be between 8-128 characters in length. 

# Technologies 

This project utilized HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages to perform its task. The majority of the project was focused on the development of the Javascript functions.

# Implementation

When navigated to the generator, the user is given the prompts to:

1. select if they would like lowercase letters

After all of the prompts, the user will:

2. see result

After the first result is given, the user can continue to click the "generate" button to keep recieving randomized passwords with their specific requests. If the user would like to remove or add one of the options (for example, remove symbols if they had previously requested they wanted them) the user would refresh and start the process over.
